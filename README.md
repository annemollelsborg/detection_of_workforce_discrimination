# Detection of workforce discrimination

To analyze, predict, and mitigate workforce inequalities by applying machine learning techniques to benchmark gender and demographic disparities, detect systemic biases, and forecast future trends in labor market equity.

Workforce inequalities remain a significant challenge across OECD countries, impacting wages, hiring practices, promotions, and leadership representation. Despite existing policies aimed at fostering equality, gender and other demographic disparities persist, often reinforced by systemic biases in recruitment, pay structures, and career progression. Traditional approaches to monitoring workplace inequality rely on historical data and retrospective analysis, offering limited predictive power and real-time bias detection.

This project aims to leverage predictive and descriptive analytics to uncover patterns of inequality, establish benchmarks for fair labor practices, and develop solutions to detect and mitigate biases in workforce-related decision-making.

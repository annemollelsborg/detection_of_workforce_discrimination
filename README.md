# Detection of workforce discrimination

The goal is to analyze, predict, and mitigate workforce inequalities by applying machine learning techniques to benchmark gender and demographic disparities, detect systemic biases, and forecast future trends in labor market equity.

Workforce inequalities remain a significant challenge across OECD countries, impacting wages, hiring practices, promotions, and leadership representation. Despite existing policies aimed at fostering equality, gender and other demographic disparities persist, often reinforced by systemic biases in recruitment, pay structures, and career progression. Traditional approaches to monitoring workplace inequality rely on historical data and retrospective analysis, offering limited predictive power and real-time bias detection.

This project aims to leverage predictive and descriptive analytics to uncover patterns of inequality, establish benchmarks for fair labor practices, and develop solutions to detect and mitigate biases in workforce-related decision-making.

- Descriptive Analytics: Analyze existing labor market data (e.g., employment rates, wages, promotions) to identify trends and disparities.
- Predictive Analytics: Use machine learning models to forecast the evolution of inequalities and the impact of policy changes.
- Bias Detection \& Mitigation: Develop algorithms to detect and quantify biases in hiring, salaries, and career advancement.
- Benchmarking \& Fairness Measures: Establish data-driven benchmarks to compare workforce equality across OECD nations and industries.
